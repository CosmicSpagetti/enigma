# The encrypt method takes a message String as an argument. It can optionally take a Key and Date as arguments to use for encryption. If the key is not included, generate a random key. If the date is not included, use todayâ€™s date.
#
# The encrypt method returns a hash with three keys:
#
# :encryption => the encrypted String
# :key => the key used for encryption as a String
# :date => the date used for encryption as a String in the form DDMMYY
